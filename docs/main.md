# Cross-Check Platform

## Purpose
Create a trusted way for people to find and recommend resources aligned with their beliefs or values. The
platform builds confidence in what you consume by letting the community cross-check resources through
recommendations and voting.

## Mission
Help individuals and communities discover, remember, and share high-quality resources with confidence.

## Core Loop
Recommend → vote → build trust.

## Who It Serves
- Communities that want a shared, trustworthy library (churches, study groups, aligned interest groups).
- Individuals who want a personal, searchable knowledge hub for what they have read, watched, or listened to.

## Guiding Principles
- Keep data models and platform language generic where possible, while allowing community-specific
	terminology in the UI.
- Trust is earned through social proof, not assumed.
- Value should increase over time as people add notes, comments, and shared context.

## Key Capabilities

### Community Library
A shared resource library where members can:
- Recommend resources and vote on them.
- See which resources have been cross-checked by others.
- Share commentary and insights that add context for future readers.

### Personal Knowledge Hub
A personal library where individuals can:
- Save resources from anywhere (links, books, sermons, videos, notes).
- Upload notes and reflections for each resource.
- Retrieve what they saved later using semantic search (RAG).

### Semantic Search on Notes and Comments
Semantic search allows people to find meaning, not just keywords. Example:
- You leave a comment on a sermon that was convicting.
- Years later, you can search for the idea or feeling and retrieve that comment.

### Book Sharing (Community Lending)
Enable physical book lending within a community:
- Track who is borrowing what and due dates.
- Send reminders when a loan is about to expire.
- Allow queues for people waiting to borrow a book.
- Let members mark books as available to lend.

## Long-Term Vision
A trusted, growing library of resources and insights that helps people consume content with discernment and
preserves what they have learned over time.
